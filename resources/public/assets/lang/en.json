	"limiterDesc": "The URS 60/URS 61 safety control unit cyclically evaluates data telegrams from up to four safety sensors of types NRG 1..., NRG 2…, LRG 1… and TRV 5. The data are transferred via ISO 11898 CAN bus using the CANopen protocol, and saved. The safety functions are monitored by cyclical self-tests. The two integrated relays are switched off in the event of alarms or errors. Function tests and failure diagnosis can be performed using the control unit or an operating terminal.\nThe data telegrams contain the following information:\n■ Sensor alarms if the limits are exceeded\n■ Fault indications on the occurrence of faults in electronic or mechanical parts\n■ Excessive temperature in the sensor terminal boxes\nBehaviour in the event of alarms\nWhen level, temperature or conductivity alarms occur, both output contacts open after a power-off delayand this interrupts the safety circuit (fail-safe position). The safety control unit does not lock independently; this function must be implemented in the downstream circuit. The URS 60 or URS 61 can only activateone safety circuit (heater or pump) at any one time.\nThe safety circuit is interrupted without a delay if the following fault indications occur:\n■ Fault in sensors (negative self-test, excessively high temperature in terminal box)\n■ Fault in control unit (negative self-test)\n■ Communication failure\n Behaviour in the event of fault indications\nCyclical self-tests monitor the safety functions of the equipment in the safety control unit and sensors.\nFault indications are updated with each self-test. If there are no faults, the message is automaticallydeleted and the output contacts close once more. Alarms and fault indications are displayed by LEDs or anoperating unit.\nIn addition, you can choose to have alarms displayed on an external signalling device via the signallingoutputs, either with or without a delay. Faults are always indicated without a delay, however.",

	"NRG_16_60_Desc": "When the water drops below the minimum level, the level electrode is no longer immersed, and the URS 60 / URS 61 safety control unit triggers an alarm. This “Low Water (LW)” switchpoint is determined by the length of the electrode extension. The level electrode monitors itself using the principle of conductive measurement. This means that a leaking or contaminated electrode insulator and/or a fault in the electrical connection also trigger an alarm. The level electrode is installed inside pressurised steam systems, tanks or feed lines in pressurised hot-water plants. A protective tube provided on site keeps it functioning reliably (see page 31 “Installation examples”). An NRG 1x-60 level electrode can be installed in a protective tube or level pot together with an NRG 1x-61 level electrode or continuous GESTRA NRG 26-60 level electrode. If a level electrode is installed in a lockable level pot outside the boiler, the connecting pipes must be flushed regularly. An SRL 6-60 monitoring unit is additionally required to monitor the flushing times and flushing process. If the steam pipe is ≥ 40 mm and the water pipe is ≥ 100mm, installation is regarded as internal. In this case, upstream monitoring of flushing processes is not required. In total, two NRG 1x-60 level electrodes can be operated in conjunction with a URS 60 / URS 61 safety control unit as a water level limiter system. An automatic self-test cyclically monitors the safety and function of the level electrode and measured value recorder. The data are transferred to the URS 60 / URS 61 safety control unit in the form of a Black Channel data telegram using the CANopen protocol via a CAN bus to ISO 11898, and saved there.\nThese data telegrams contain the following information:\n■ Alarm indications from the level electrode if water drops below the minimum level\n■ Fault indications in the event of faults in electronic or mechanical parts\n■ Excessive temperature in the level electrode terminal box",
